config HPI_TODAY_SCREEN
		bool "Enable TODAY screen"
		default y
		help
			Enable the TODAY screen showing daily activity summary (steps, calories,
			active time). Disable to temporarily exclude from build during debugging
			or to save flash/RAM. When disabled, screen is excluded from navigation.

config HPI_GSR_SCREEN
		bool "Enable GSR screen"
		default y
		help
			Enable the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) UI screens and related code.
			Disable to save flash/RAM and remove GSR UI. When disabled, GSR
			source files are excluded and runtime hooks become no-ops.

config HPI_GSR_STRESS_INDEX
		bool "Enable GSR stress index calculation"
		default y
		depends on HPI_GSR_SCREEN
		help
			Enable stress index calculation from GSR measurements including
			tonic/phasic separation, peak detection, and arousal scoring.
			Adds ~2KB flash and ~300 bytes RAM for history buffers.
			Disable to save memory if only raw GSR values are needed.

config HPI_RECORDING_MODULE
		bool "Enable background recording module"
		default y
		help
			Enable multi-signal background recording with BLE configuration.
			Supports recording PPG (wrist/finger), IMU, and GSR data for
			configurable durations. Data is stored in LittleFS and retrieved
			via MCUMgr FS commands over BLE.

config HPI_RECORDING_MAX_DURATION_S
		int "Maximum recording duration in seconds"
		default 3600
		range 60 7200
		depends on HPI_RECORDING_MODULE
		help
			Maximum allowed recording duration in seconds.
			Default is 3600 (1 hour). Range: 60s to 7200s (2 hours).

config HPI_RECORDING_BUFFER_SIZE
		int "Recording buffer size per signal (bytes)"
		default 1024
		range 512 4096
		depends on HPI_RECORDING_MODULE
		help
			Size of each dual-buffer for recording. Larger buffers reduce
			write frequency but use more RAM. Each signal uses 2x this size.
			Default is 1024 bytes (2KB per signal, 10KB total for 5 signals).
